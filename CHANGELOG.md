# Changelog

This changelog tracks user-visible changes to published Intuition skills.

The source of truth for the current published version of a skill is the
`metadata.version` field in that skill's `SKILL.md`. See `RELEASING.md` for the
release policy, semantic versioning rules, and publish checklist.

## Unreleased

Changes merged to `main` but not yet published belong here. Move them into a
versioned section as part of the release PR.

### Added

### Changed

### Removed

## erc8004-agent-layer 0.1.0 - 2026-08-04

### Added

- A dedicated, self-contained `erc8004-agent-layer` skill for canonical ERC-8004 identity, classification, trust-provider, and assessment-source semantic planning.
- An executable, network-aware registry for exact shared-vocabulary term IDs, including canonical predicates, standards, chains, trust models, and OASF taxonomy entries.
- Deterministic planner and validator scripts with fresh identity preflight checks, registry-extension stops, tamper detection, and canonical artifact output.
- A non-transitive approval ladder that separates semantic planning, protocol preview, metadata pinning, testnet execution, mainnet preview, and mainnet execution.
- Partner-facing install guidance, cold-start validation prompts, offline invariants, and read-only live registry verification for both Intuition networks.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-03

### Added

- `tests/core-pinning-contract.test.mjs` covering read/pin endpoint separation, host-configured SDK pinning, fail-closed behavior when configuration is missing, and trusted credential storage guidance.

### Changed

- Structured-atom workflows now use `@0xintuition/sdk` 3.0.1 or newer, or an equivalent host-provided server adapter, while network-specific `$GRAPHQL` endpoints remain read-only discovery surfaces.
- Pinning credentials are explicitly owned by the consuming application's trusted runtime, with local, CI, and deployment storage guidance that keeps keys out of prompts, skill files, browser bundles, logs, and transaction output.
- Autonomous pinning prompts now assume a preconfigured host capability and include a missing-configuration refusal case.

### Fixed

- Replaced the unusable keyless pin-mutation path against `$GRAPHQL` with the canonical authenticated pinning boundary at `https://pin.intuition.systems/v1/graphql`.
- Missing or failed pinning now stops before transaction generation with the existing `pin_failed` output shape; missing configuration uses a reason beginning `pinning_configuration_required` and never falls back to a plain-string atom.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-27

### Added

- `reference/nested-triples.md` documenting nested-triple discovery, classification, construction, and rendering patterns, including the polymorphic `*_term` GraphQL fragment and the `getVaultType` / `isTermCreated` preflight contract.
- Type-aware term classification reads in `reference/reading-state.md` and `reference/graphql-queries.md` so agents can distinguish atoms, positive triples, and counter-triples from any term position.
- `tests/prompts/b1-nested-triple-prompts.md` covering nested-triple discovery, `getVaultType` classification, construction preflight, counter-triple safety, polymorphic rendering, and unknown-term refusal.
- `scripts/nested-triple-smoke.sh` verifying the three-valued GraphQL discriminator, on-chain classifier ordinals, polymorphic `*_term` shape, nested-fixture rendering, and the existence-guard vs type-family-boolean asymmetry on unknown ids.

### Changed

- `operations/create-triples.md` broadens triple positions to accept any term type (atom or triple) so positive triples can be reused as subject, predicate, or object directly without re-creation.
- `reference/graphql-queries.md` previews now use the polymorphic `subject_term` / `predicate_term` / `object_term` relationships in place of the legacy atom-only `subject` / `predicate` / `object` relations, so triple-valued positions render safely.
- `SKILL.md` error table now distinguishes `MultiVault_TermDoesNotExist` (creation-side revert) from `MultiVaultCore_TermDoesNotExist` (classifier read against an unknown id) and surfaces both selectors.
- `reference/autonomous-policy.md` preflight step 5 now requires `getVaultType(termId) == 1` for positive triple positions and explicitly warns against using `isTriple` alone, which is coarse and returns true for counter-triples.
- `reference/workflows.md`, `reference/simulation.md`, and skill routing docs now use term-aware language for triple components throughout.

### Fixed

- `scripts/pass2-edge-case-tests.sh` switches revert assertions from name-match to selector-match (`0xb4856ebc` for `MultiVault_AtomExists`, `0x4762af7d` for `MultiVault_TermDoesNotExist`) so the suite remains stable across cast version drift; also normalizes newer cast uint output, defaults `SENDER` to the MultiVault address, and silences the foundry nightly warning.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `reference/post-write-verification.md` for receipt checks, deterministic term-ID reconstruction, on-chain state deltas, and indexer-lag handling after writes.
- `operations/approve.md` as the first-class delegated approval flow for deposit and redeem operations.
- `reference/config-fields.md` covering the five protocol config reads and which fields are safety-critical for tx generation.
- `reference/network-config.md` as the canonical source for Intuition network metadata, session env values, and viem chain definitions.
- Shipped runtime-enforcement reference assets with the skill artifact: `reference/runtime-enforcement.md`, `reference/autonomous-policy.example.json`, and the `reference/schemas/*.json` output-contract files.

### Changed

- README now leads with explicit prerequisites, installation guidance, and two executable testnet quickstarts: Discovery -> Deposit and Pin -> Encode -> Create.
- GraphQL guidance now documents the discovery-to-write bridge, cache freshness, and when on-chain reads override indexer results.
- Operation docs now point back to `SKILL.md` Protocol Invariants for the full rule set while keeping only operation-specific reminders in place.
- Autonomous policy and runtime-enforcement docs now describe an executor-owned blocking validation pattern instead of implying bundled signer middleware.

### Fixed

- Batch deposit and batch redeem guidance now requires preview-derived per-item slippage bounds instead of unsafe zero-filled defaults.
- Atom and triple creation docs now follow canonical pinned-atom flows, use aligned preview/value handling, and preserve valid cost-only creation semantics.
- Post-write verification guidance now reflects actual receipt/event behavior and cost-only initialized vault semantics.
- Delegated deposit and redeem flows now clearly require approval to mine before the downstream write broadcasts, including batch operations.
- Config semantics now correctly scope `minDeposit`, `feeThreshold`, and fee-helper behavior.
- The shipped machine-readable contract is now one canonical shape end-to-end: `value` and `chainId` are base-10 strings, approval examples include `checks`, and pin-failure output remains explicit.

### Removed

- Duplicated README sections that restated canonical write semantics already defined in `SKILL.md`.
